FFMPEG INFO:

To extract the audio stream without re-encoding:

ffmpeg -i input-video.avi -vn -acodec copy output-audio.aac

    -vn is no video.
    -acodec copy says use the same audio stream that's already in there.

Read the output to see what codec it is, to set the right filename extension.


to convert to wav: 
ffmpeg -i my_video.mp4 output_audio.wav
